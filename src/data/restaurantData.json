Known as a favorite for both locals and visitors alike, RingSide Steakhouse offers a wide variety of USDA prime & certified Angus natural beef, and also has one of Portland’s only on-premise dry aging rooms. Start your meal with our famous onion rings, the same ones that James Beard claimed to be “the best I’ve ever had” and move on to a dry aged, bone-in rib eye for two. Pair the evening with a bottle from our list of over 700 labels and finish things off with our house made classic vanilla bean crème brulée. A trip to Portland is not complete without enjoying the full RingSide experience.","firstCourse":["Baked onion soup","Mixed greens and vegetables"],"secondCourse":["Tender steak medallions with sauce chasseur and garlic mashed potatoes"],"thirdCourse":["Crème brûlée"],"coords":{"lat":45.52350320000001,"lng":-122.6957644}},{"classList":["row","single-poi-list-item","japanese","seafood","sw-portland","post-52851","poi","type-poi","status-publish","hentry","category-japanese","category-seafood","feature-hot-right-now","region-sw-portland","is-not-child"],"name":"Roe","image":"https://www.travelportland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Roe-web-1.jpg","website":"http://www.roepdx.rest/","tags":["SW Portland","Japanese, Seafood"],"address":"515 S.W.
