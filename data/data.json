After immigrating to the U.S. in 1984, she attended Portland State while her parents opened the popular Nichola’s Restaurant. Hoda’s passion for fresh, delicious flavors led her to open Hoda’s with her husband, Hani, and their three children (including three-month-old twins). Today they carry on the tradition of Nicolas’s welcoming atmosphere with true Middle Eastern hospitality, serving recipes developed and cooked by Hoda herself, using only the freshest organic, locally sourced ingredients."

Patricia’s love of history, art and traditional cuisine comes from her experiences growing up in Morelia, Michoacan and her frequent trips to Mexico, where she researches the local gastronomy and its cultural influences. All this is represented in the many posters and prints that decorate the brightly colored walls of the restaurant. Some of the furniture and crafts are Patricia’s own art creations."

Start your meal with our famous onion rings, the same ones that James Beard claimed to be “the best I’ve ever had” and move on to a dry aged, bone-in rib eye for two. Pair the evening with a bottle from our list of over 700 labels and finish things off with our house made classic vanilla bean crème brulée. A trip to Portland is not complete without enjoying the full RingSide experience."
